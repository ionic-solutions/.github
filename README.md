## About Us

Enterprise and organization metadata: who we are, areas of focus,
documentation, and design schematicsâ€¦

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

`{r cars} summary(cars)`

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

`{r pressure, echo=FALSE} plot(pressure)`

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
